# 2D-Dungeon-Crawler
A 2D dungeon crawler game made entirely using the pygame library.

Is a zip because there were too many files to add.

To play just load main.py in python then run it, click play and click on a character then you can play. Press e to use your skills and f to interact, left click to attack and right click to parry.

Have fun!
